This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


## Purpose

This is a simple game ntended as an exercise in using the most
basic parts of React's state management.

### Keeping all the state together

It may not actually be the 'best' way in this particular application
to keep all the state at the 'App' level, but I wanted to do it that
way.

 - Partly to practice modifying App state from a component
 - As practice for more complex applications where having a
 single source of the truth becomes more important.
